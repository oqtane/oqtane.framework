Oqtane is a Modular Application Framework. It leverages Blazor, an open source and cross-platform web UI framework for building single-page apps using .NET and C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.

Oqtane is being developed based on some fundamental principles which are outlined in the [Oqtane Philosophy](https://www.oqtane.org/Resources/Blog/PostId/538/oqtane-philosophy).

# Getting Started

**Using Version 2+:**

- Install **[.NET 5 SDK (v5.0.100)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)**.
   
- Install the latest edition (v16.8 or higher) of [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) (Community, Professional, or Enterprise Editions) with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload enabled. Oqtane works with ALL editions of Visual Studio from Community to Enterprise. If you do not have a SQL Server installation available already and you wish to use LocalDB for development, you must also install the **.NET desktop development workload**.  

- Download a release or Clone the Oqtane source code to your local system. Open the **Oqtane.sln** solution file and Build the solution. Make sure you specify Oqtane.Server as the Startup Project and then Run the application.

**Using Version 1:**

- Install **[.NET Core 3.1 SDK (v3.1.300)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/sdk-3.1.300-windows-x64-installer)**.
   
- Install [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs) (Community, Professional, or Enterprise Editions) with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload enabled. Oqtane works with ALL editions of Visual Studio from Community to Enterprise. If you do not have a SQL Server installation available already and you wish to use LocalDB for development, you must also install the **.NET desktop development workload**.  

- Download a release or Clone the Oqtane source code from a v1.x Tag to your local system. Open the **Oqtane.sln** solution file and Build the solution. Make sure you specify Oqtane.Server as the Startup Project and then Run the application.

**Installing an official release:**

- A detailed set of instructions for installing Oqtane on IIS is located here: [Installing Oqtane on IIS](https://www.oqtane.org/Resources/Blog/PostId/542/installing-oqtane-on-iis)
- Instructions for upgrading Oqtane are located here: [Upgrading Oqtane](https://www.oqtane.org/Resources/Blog/PostId/543/upgrading-oqtane)

**Additional Instructions**

- If you have already installed a previous version of Oqtane and you wish to do a clean database install, simply reset the DefaultConnection value in the Oqtane.Server\appsettings.json file to "". This will trigger a re-install when you run the application which will execute the database installation scripts.
   
- If you want to submit pull requests make sure you install the [Github Extension For Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.github.com/). It is recommended you ignore any local changes you have made to the appsettings.json file before you submit a pull request. To automate this activity, open a command prompt and navigate to the /Oqtane.Server/ folder and enter the command "git update-index --skip-worktree appsettings.json" 

**Video Series**

- If you are getting started with Oqtane, a [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPfUZPlRRCE&list=PLYhXmd7yV0elLNLfQwZBUlM7ZSMYPTZ_f) are available which explain how to install the product, interact with the user interface, and develop custom modules.

# Documentation
There is a separate [Documentation repository](https://github.com/oqtane/oqtane.docs) which contains a variety of types of documentation for Oqtane, including API documentation that is auto generated using Docfx. The contents of the repository is published to Githib Pages and is available at [https://docs.oqtane.org](https://docs.oqtane.org/)

# Background
Oqtane was created by [Shaun Walker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaunbrucewalker/) and is inspired by the DotNetNuke web application framework. Initially created as a proof of concept, Oqtane is a native Blazor application written from the ground up using modern .NET Core technology. It is a modular application framework offering a fully dynamic page compositing model, multi-site support, designer friendly templates (skins), and extensibility via third party modules.
