# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We make every effort to ensure rapid and thorough analysis of reported issues and, where appropriate, provide workarounds and updated application releases to fix them. If you identify a potential security vulnerability please report it via support@oqtane.org.

All submitted information is viewed only by members of the Oqtane Security Team, and will not be discussed outside the Team without the permission of the person/company who reported the issue. Each confirmed issue is assigned a severity level (critical, moderate, or low) corresponding to its potential impact on an Oqtane installation.

* **Critical** means the issue can be exploited by a remote attacker to gain access to data or functionality. All critical issue security bulletins include a recommended workaround or fix that should be applied as soon as possible.
* **Moderate** means the issue can compromise data or functionality on a portal/website only if some other condition is met (e.g. a particular module or a user within a particular role is required). Moderate issue security bulletins typically include recommended actions to resolve the issue.
* **Low** means the issue is very difficult to exploit or has a limited potential impact.

Once an issue has been resolved via a public release of Oqtane, the release notes on GitHub are updated to reflect that security bulletins exist for the release. We strongly suggest using the "Watch" option on GitHub for "Releases" at a minimum to receive notifications of updated Oqtane releases.

As a general policy, Oqtane does not issue Hot Fix releases to prior versions of the software.  If a remediation is possible via configuration it shall be noted as applicable in the posted bulletins.
